Proof of Concept: Login and Registration System using React and Node.js


**Environment variables:**

DB_USER: `marker`

DB_PASSWORD: `WiBht0IABlcxXQBO`


This proof of concept showcases a simple login and registration system built with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, allowing users to log in or register with an email and password.

Code Structure:
- The code consists of a React component for the frontend.
- `App.js` includes the main structure of the frontend, providing the UI for login and registration, along with the interaction with the backend.


Usage Instructions:
1. Ensure Node.js is installed: https://nodejs.org/
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js) directories separately using the terminal or command prompt.
4. Run `npm i` in both directories to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Start the backend server by navigating to the backend directory and running `node server.js`.
6. Start the frontend by navigating to the frontend directory and running `npm start`.
7. Once both servers are running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access the login/registration interface.


Instructions for Usage:
- Upon accessing the interface:
  - For login, enter your registered email and password, then click the "Login" button.
  - For registration, enter a new email and password, then click the "Register" button.

Note: This proof of concept demonstrates a basic login and registration system using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Ensure both servers are running to test the login and registration functionalities properly.
