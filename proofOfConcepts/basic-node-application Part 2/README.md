Proof of Concept: Enhanced Node.js Server with URL Routing

This proof of concept contains an enhanced Node.js server that handles different routes and responds accordingly to specific endpoints.


Code Structure:
- The code consists of a single file.
- `server.js` contains the Node.js server setup.


Usage Instructions:
1. Install Node.js if not already installed: https://nodejs.org/
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the following command to start the server:
    `node server.js`
5. Note: This is a basic proof of concept and doesn't contain extensive features. It serves as a more comprehensive example for handling various routes in a Node.js server.
