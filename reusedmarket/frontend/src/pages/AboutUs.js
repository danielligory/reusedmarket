                <p>
                    ReUsedMarket aims to provide a user-friendly and dynamic online store, comparable to established 
                    marketplaces such as eBay, CEX, and Craigslist. Developed as a Final Year Project by Daniel Ligory 
                    at Royal Holloway, University of London, the platform seeks to mimic the experience of physical 
                    shopping with secure payment gateways, shopping cart functionality, and an efficient checkout process, 
                    all while being as credible as mainstream online stores.
